# Architectural Improvements TODO

This document outlines potential architectural improvements for the LuaCube project, organized by module.

## Renderer Module

- **Base Renderer Classes**: Enhance the base renderer classes to provide more common functionality, reducing code duplication in concrete renderers
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Implement standardized error handling for all rendering operations
- **Renderer Lifecycle Management**: Add explicit initialization and cleanup methods to all renderers
- **Plugin System**: Create a plugin system for renderers to allow easy extension with post-processing effects

## Cube Module

- **Move Cube-Specific Geometry**: Consider moving geometry.lua into the rendering.lua file since it's so tightly coupled with rendering
- **Separate Cube Creation from Rendering**: Ensure clear separation between cube data structures and their visualization
- **Material System**: Implement a material system for cubes to support different textures and surface properties

## Entity Module

- **Entity Component System**: Consider restructuring entities to follow an ECS pattern, which would make adding new entity types and behaviors cleaner
- **Decouple Animation from Rendering**: Ensure animation logic is completely separate from rendering logic
- **State Machine**: Implement a proper state machine for entity behavior

## World Module

- **Terrain-Entity Interaction**: Add proper interfaces for terrain and entity interaction
- **Spatial Partitioning**: Implement a spatial partitioning system to optimize rendering and interactions
- **Scene Graph**: Consider implementing a scene graph for better organization of world objects
- **Chunk Loading**: Implement a chunk-based loading system for large worlds

## Cross-Module Improvements

- **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Standardize naming across all modules (files, functions, methods)
- **Configuration Management**: Implement a centralized configuration system accessible to all modules
- **Dependency Injection**: Use dependency injection more extensively to reduce tight coupling
- **Event-Based Communication**: Expand the event system for better inter-module communication
- **Lazy Initialization**: Implement consistent lazy initialization patterns across modules
- **Interface Documentation**: Add explicit interface documentation to make it clear how modules should interact

## Asset Management

- **Create a Separate Asset Module**: Move all asset loading (textures, shaders) to a dedicated asset management module
- **Resource Pooling**: Implement resource pooling for meshes, textures, and other shared resources
- **Hot Reloading**: Add support for hot reloading of assets during development

## Performance Optimizations

- **Unified Profiling System**: Add standardized performance metrics across all modules
- **Consistent View Frustum Culling**: Implement consistent culling across all renderable objects
- **Memory Pool**: Use object pools to reduce garbage collection pressure
- **Batch Processing**: Implement batch processing for physics, animations, and other systems

## UI and Input

- **UI Module**: Create a dedicated UI module with consistent rendering and input handling
- **Input Mapping**: Create a flexible input mapping system
- **Controller Support**: Add support for game controllers

## Testing and Stability

- **Unit Testing**: Add a testing framework and write unit tests for core functionality
- **Integration Testing**: Add integration tests for module interactions
- **Benchmarking**: Create benchmarks for performance-critical systems
- **Error Recovery**: Implement graceful recovery from errors

## Build and Deployment

- **Build System**: Add a proper build system for managing dependencies and packaging
- **Versioning**: Implement semantic versioning
- **Configuration Profiles**: Add support for different configuration profiles (development, production, etc.)
