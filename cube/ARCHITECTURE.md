# Cube Module Architecture

## Overview

The cube module provides a comprehensive system for managing, rendering, and manipulating 3D cubes in an isometric environment. It handles cube geometry, visibility determination, and integrates with the camera module for proper projection and rendering.

The module serves as a core building block of the 3D visualization system, providing both the data structures and algorithms needed to represent and display cubes with proper depth, lighting, and perspective effects. It abstracts the complexities of 3D geometry while offering a clean interface for the rest of the application.

## Module Structure

The cube module is divided into three logical components, each with a specific responsibility:

1. **Core**: Manages basic cube properties, creation, and initialization. Handles the fundamental data structures that represent a cube and provides the public API for cube instantiation.
2. **Geometry**: Handles cube vertices, faces, and visibility calculations. Implements the mathematical operations for determining cube structure and which faces should be visible.
3. **Rendering**: Implements drawing, coloring, and depth management. Translates the geometric information into visual output using the appropriate rendering techniques.

## Key Features / Algorithms

### Cube Geometry
The cube geometry is defined using:

1. **Normalized Corner Offsets**: Eight vertices positioned relative to a center point, providing a consistent structure regardless of world position.
2. **Face Definitions**: Six faces defined as groups of four corners each, organizing vertices into renderable polygons.
3. **World Transformation**: Translating the normalized cube to a specific world position, maintaining the relative positions of vertices.

### Backface Culling
A key optimization is determining which faces are visible from the current viewing angle:

1. **Normal Calculation**: Compute the face normal using the cross product of two edge vectors, establishing the direction the face is pointing.
2. **View Direction**: Compare the normal with the standard isometric view direction to determine relative orientation.
3. **Visibility Test**: Faces are visible when their normal points toward the camera, which eliminates drawing faces that would be hidden.

### Depth Sorting
For proper rendering of overlapping faces:

1. **Face Depth**: Calculate depth value for each visible face using a specialized formula.
2. **Painter's Algorithm**: Sort faces by depth and draw from back to front, ensuring correct visual layering.

### Face Coloring System
Each face has a different brightness to enhance the 3D appearance:

1. **Base Color**: The fundamental color of the cube, defining its overall appearance.
2. **Brightness Factors**: Multipliers for each face to simulate lighting from a consistent light source.
3. **Final Color**: Product of base color and face-specific brightness, creating the illusion of depth and lighting.

## Data Flow

1. **Creation**: A cube is instantiated with position and color parameters
2. **Geometry Processing**: 3D corners are calculated and visible faces determined based on viewing angle
3. **Projection**: 3D positions are transformed to 2D screen coordinates via the camera module
4. **Depth Sorting**: Visible faces are sorted from back to front for proper layering
5. **Rendering**: Each face is drawn with appropriate color and shading
6. **Debug Information**: Optional debug data is broadcast to the event system

## Integration with Other Modules

1. **Camera Module**: The cube module relies on the camera module for converting 3D corners to 2D screen coordinates, calculating depth, and handling the actual polygon rendering.
2. **Event System**: Debug information about vertices, faces, and rendering state is broadcast through events for monitoring and debugging.
3. **Debug Module**: Visual debugging features like outline rendering are coordinated with the debug module to enable development tools.

## Performance Considerations

- **Backface Culling**: Reduces the number of faces to process and draw, significantly improving rendering performance for complex scenes
- **Efficient Depth Sorting**: Sorting is performed once per cube, minimizing sort operations and computational overhead
- **Data Reuse**: Face calculations reuse corner data to avoid redundant transformations and memory duplication
- **Minimal State**: The module maintains only the necessary state information to reduce memory usage

## Extendability

The architecture is designed to be extended in several ways:

1. Add different cube types with specialized properties (e.g., textured, animated, or interactive cubes)
2. Implement texturing or advanced shading models for more realistic visual representation
3. Support additional shapes beyond cubes while reusing the visibility and depth-sorting algorithms
4. Add animation capabilities for movement and transformation
5. Implement more sophisticated lighting models for enhanced visual effects

## Implementation Details (Optional)

### Debug Features
The module includes several debug capabilities to aid in development:

1. **Vertex Information**: Logging the position of each projected vertex for troubleshooting
2. **Face Information**: Broadcasting face composition and state for monitoring
3. **Visual Debugging**: Optional outline rendering of faces to visualize the structure
